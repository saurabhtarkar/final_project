|-1|,|after sever year of tortur in the hand of at&t custom servic i am delight to drop them and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phon from at&t to t-mobil|
|-1|,|! the dai final arriv when i wa sure i 'd leav sprint|
|-1|,|after year with that carrier 's expens plan and horribl custom servic portabl seem heaven-s|
|-1|,|i spent hour sett up the station ( accept about 1|,3-1|,4 i believ ) though the recept is unpredict|
|-1|,|the headset that come with the phone ha good sound volum but it hurt the ear like you cannot imagin|
|-1|,|! the phone come with okai rington some decent background / screensav but the phone ha veri littl memori ( mine had 230kb as it arriv from amazon so you do n't have too mani option on what you can put on there )|
|-1|,|the color on the screen ar not as crisp as i 'd have like them to be|
|-1|,|the backlight on the phone goe off wai too quickli ( danger when you 're drive at night ) and there 's no wai to chang thi -- the button on the phone ar small even for my small fingertip but you get us to them rather quickli|
|-1|,|the menu option ar uncr as you can 't see a full screen of menu item to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're look for ( ye thi is minor but not when you 're try to keep your eye on the road|
|-1|,|! )|
|-1|,|the bodycover is so ugly|
|-1|,|i have excel hear but the volum level on thi phone is especi quiet|
|-1|,|i assum thei had except servic but their recept in my area ( lo angel ) is horrend|
|-1|,|also their t-zone although cheap ( $ 499 / mo ) never work|
|-1|,|sinc i receiv the phone i spent countless hour on the phone with custom servic rep who promis t-zone would work "		in		24		hour		"|
|-1|,|i must have heard thi about a dozen time over the span of 2 week when t-zone never work|
|-1|,|appar t-mobil is heavili back-logg and can 't keep up with demand|
|-1|,|howev the call constantli drop in my area and i experinc mega-stat to the point where i 'd have to dial number 201|,5/07/06 time to get a clear line|
|1|,|there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone it is a great phone mine worked without any problems right out of the box|
|1|,|i have had the phone for 1|, week the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 far superior to at &#38 t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route|
|1|,|my favorite features although there are many are the speaker phone the radio and the infrared|
|1|,|the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car very audible even with freeway noise|
|1|,|the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone saved me hours of re-entering my numbers|
|1|,|here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny cute feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) but seems pretty sturdy|
|1|,|it has lots of little cute features my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- ie organizer ) and the radio !|
|1|,|the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !|
|1|,|the phone comes with okay ringtones some decent backgrounds / screensavers but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there )|
|1|,|on the up-side the phone has amazing battery life|
|1|,|i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 35 ) but unforutnately i am returning it|
|1|,|in all fairness customer reps are very nice and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions|
|1|,|t-mobile is trying very hard and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's|
|1|,|i 'm staying with sprint and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's the clarity of their reception is exceptional|
|1|,|while i like the performance of the phone in every regard i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it|
|1|,|i highly recommend a nokia 661|,0|
|1|,|no other color phone has the combination of features that the 661|,0 offers|
|1|,|from the speakerphone that can be used up to 1|,5 feet away with clarity to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone|
|1|,|whether you 're taking a brisk jog waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park you 'll be glad you had the fm radio|
|1|,|i treat the battery well and it has lasted|
|1|,|overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned|
|1|,|great battery life perfect size but a tid bit quieter than i would like|
|1|,|it has a nice color screen|
|1|,|it is small|
|1|,|radio is awsome but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in|
|1|,|t-mobile was a pretty good server|
|1|,|this is a very nice phone but there is no warranty on it|
|1|,|while i had the phone the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece|
|1|,|the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make|
|1|,|this phone is a winner|
|1|,|anything this phone does it does perfectly|
|1|,|the speakerphone the radio all features work perfectly|
|1|,|this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone|
|1|,|as said before this works perfectly|
|1|,|you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance|
|1|,|the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly|
|1|,|you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly|
|1|,|this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in|
|1|,|this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly|
|1|,|i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly|
|1|,|anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception|
|1|,|another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone the 661|,0 is sold in almost everywhere in the world|
|1|,|this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones|
|1|,|when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh so light|
|1|,|this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket|
|1|,|the battery life on this phone is surreal|
|1|,|i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar|
|1|,|it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light|
|1|,|this phone has many other features ir just to name one the features above i view as the most beneficial|
|1|,|overall i highly recommend this phone|
|1|,|it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package|
|1|,|size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you|
|1|,|sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio which is a nice feature when you are bored|
|1|,|speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch|
|1|,|surfing the web on it is nice as well i just wish there were more wap pages available|
|1|,|nice little phone  light compact|
|1|,|although the nokia 661|,0 is a little short on the features department it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone|
|1|,|the reception and sound quality are top-notch|
|1|,|i like the size and weight of this little critter|
|1|,|i am able to carry it close to my body in places where other phones are not so easily concealed|
|1|,|the screen is bright easy to see in the daylight with nice colors|
|1|,|it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones|
|1|,|but then again the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office when i was already out on the street|
|1|,|- light compact design|
|1|,|- solid high-quality construction|
|1|,|- well-backlit keypad|
|1|,|- outstanding signal reception|
|1|,|- excellent sound quality|
|1|,|- bright visible screen|
|1|,|- speakerphone|
|1|,|- very long-lasting battery life|
|1|,|one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date|
|1|,|i like the speakphone function a lot|
|1|,|i am very pleased with its quality and durability|
|1|,|i like the automatic key lock function|
|1|,|the phone is very light weight|
|1|,|the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited|
|1|,|the fm radio is cool|
|1|,|while going for a cellphone i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones|
|1|,|and really this is the best phone one could have|
|1|,|it has all the features one would need in a cellphone|
|1|,|it is lightweight sleek and attractive|
|1|,|this phone is very user-friendly easy to manipulate &#38 very convenient to scroll in menu etc|
|1|,|it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime|
|1|,|its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently lying on bed &#38 phone lying by your pillowside|
|1|,|it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes|
|1|,|i am enjoying my phone a lot|
|-1|,|small size|
|1|,|i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it|
|1|,|color screen is good|
|1|,|it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar|
|1|,|the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing|
|1|,|navigating through the menus is super easy especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone|
|1|,|battery life is very good i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so|
|1|,|nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception|
|1|,|the loud speaker function on the 661|,0 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk|
|1|,|i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets|
|1|,|overall this is a slightly better than average phone|
|1|,|this is the best phone i have seen|
|1|,|the phones are awesome|
|1|,|we hardly ever have to charge them get great reception ( live in chicago ) and the customization and applications are awesome|
|1|,|you can do * so * much more with the pc suite ie free ringtones from midi files free graphics from any picture on your computer and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games|
|1|,|the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet people this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing|
|1|,|i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it|
|1|,|nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games graphics and ringtones from wwwcrazycellphonecom|
|1|,|i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had|
|1|,|the features are really cool like the radio|
|1|,|the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it|
|1|,|technology wise i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !|
|1|,|i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone|
|1|,|for a specific location i still think its a great phone|
|1|,|this really is a great little phone its got nice features a beatiful screen great ergonomics and its tiny !|
|1|,|this phone won me over and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out|
|1|,|nokia was my first nonflip phone and i 'm glad i decided to go with them|
|1|,|first of all my calls were loud and clear unlike with sprint|
|1|,|i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment )|
|1|,|the phone is small light and very attractive|
|1|,|the battery life is amazing|
|1|,|the color screen is a plus as are the polyphonic ringtones|
|1|,|i 'm not one who uses web browsing so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs|
|1|,|i highly recommend this phone to anyone|
|1|,|it is a great phone if you are traveling all over the world packed with wonderful features|
|1|,|this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology )|
|1|,|the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone i used to own )|
|1|,|i simply love this feature|
|1|,|in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset|
|1|,|the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport|
|1|,|the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth )|
|1|,|additionally it has more fun stuff like more tones wallpapers screensaver stop clock alarm java applications ( chess currency converter etc )|
|1|,|the mobile text messaging chat picture sharing etc other nicities that you would enjoy|
|1|,|the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone which you will enjoy|
|1|,|i can recommend this phone to anyone anytime|
|1|,|not only is it the perfect size ( not too small not too large ) it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want|
|1|,|in TRUE nokia style the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned|
|1|,|the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent|
|1|,|even better with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio|
|1|,|however the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off|
|1|,|overall this is the best phone i have ever owned|
|1|,|nokia does not disappoint in this model|
|1|,|it has great battery life fm radio excellent signal hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps|
|1|,|great phone|
|1|,|great features|
|1|,|i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size speakerphone option great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email|
|1|,|i have had no problems with the phone|
|1|,|great phone i 'd buy another|
|1|,|excellent phone the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures|
|1|,|overall an excellent phone|
|1|,|the service from t-mobile is very good too|
|1|,|great phone easy to use excellent network no regrets ! ! !|
|1|,|i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it|
|1|,|nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby|
|1|,|service is great as far as i can tell features work like a charm ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great|
|1|,|this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range or like me do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones|
|1|,|1|, month no problems great phone i 'm very pleased with my 661|,0 phone|
|1|,|yes the features are numerous|
|1|,|the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had|
|1|,|the sound quality is excellent except maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line|
|1|,|the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use|
|1|,|i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before|
|1|,|first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better|
|1|,|the radio feature has superb sound quality|
|1|,|it has a classic design yet looks hip|
|1|,|it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket|
|1|,|the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there|
|1|,|this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities|
|1|,|it does well in all aspects of internet browsing|
|1|,|battery life is good for a phone of this size|
|1|,|but anyway the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing|
|1|,|great screen and great sound|
|1|,|the 661|,0 excels as a cell phone thank god|
|1|,|the voice quality is very good and it gets great reception ( that is in places where you get t-mobile coverage which is not that good see below )|
|1|,|the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright and commands are very responsive|
|1|,|other than that this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips|
|1|,|the nokia 661|,0 is a relatively new phone and what a great phone it is|
|1|,|after using it i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket|
|1|,|it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included|
|1|,|when i turned the phone on the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is|
|1|,|the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !|
|1|,|the ringtones included are awesome and did i mention they were polyphonic ?|
|1|,|you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call|
|1|,|the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) a calendar / organizer alarm clock with snooze fm radio ( way cool even if it is just through an ear-peice ) games java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection|
|1|,|the gprs connection is sometimes slow and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain but the other t-zones applications are quite useful|
|1|,|all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved|
|1|,|the rate plans are also very good at least for me|
|1|,|this phone is highly recommended otherwise|
|1|,|nokia makes a great phone that 's clear|
|1|,|with all its complicated features the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great|
|1|,|this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it|
|1|,|the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution|
|1|,|it is very light weight and has a good signal strength|
|1|,|but i would definately recommend this phone|
|1|,|it is crystal clear|
|1|,|this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made|
|-1|,|the volum level of the phone is not all that good|
|-1|,|some of the higher pitch ring ar veri easi to hear but not easi to listen to|
|-1|,|the more subtl tone that were includ with the phone ar hard to hear at time|
|-1|,|the vibrat is not top|
|-1|,|great batteri life perfect size but a tid bit quieter than i would like|
|-1|,|i am bore with the silver look|
|-1|,|radio is awsom but it doe n't work unless you have the earpic in|
|-1|,|thei ar not wowabl good|
|-1|,|it also doe n't have voic activat dial|
|-1|,|big minu|
|-1|,|!|
|-1|,|! thi is a veri nice phone but there is no warranti on it|
|-1|,|we got two phone for the t-mobil famili plan ( inde veri easi to switch to the famili plan ) and on came with a broken headphon ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and on di todai after less than two week of us|
|-1|,|when i got it home i discov that the menu option for send messag via either text or email simpli were n't there : neg : imposs tini and difficult to oper bare visibl power button|
|-1|,|poor visibl on the kei|
|-1|,|onli con i can think of is no camera|
|-1|,|onli on complaint about the speakerphon you can onli activ the speakerphon featur onc the person you ar call answer the phone not while it is ring|
|-1|,|the onli problem i had wa a small glitch with t-mobil|
|-1|,|the phone ha a few minor inconveni but onli becaus it lack those featur bluetooth and high spend internet but there ar veri few problem with thing that you expect thi phone to do|
|-1|,|ring tone onli come with crazi song and annoi ring there is onli on ring that sound close to a regular ring|
|-1|,|the screen is easili scratch but if you have the warranti you should be abl to swap it out|
|-1|,|game kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cabl to get addit game|
|-1|,|button do seem a littl sticki tho  and the hand free kit ' connector might be a problem  the kei ar close togeth and the layout is a bit funki in relat to standard rectangular layout keypad but it 's not too weird|
|-1|,|the fact that the "		0		" kei is the space kei for text input is a bit confus as mani phone us the "		#		" kei instead|
|-1|,|there ar some featur in the user interfac that i find a littl inconveni|
|-1|,|the menu option appear on at a time take up the whole screen and on ha to scroll down on by on or have memoriz where thei ar in the menu order to select them by us the number keypad|
|-1|,|the vibrat sett is loud|
|-1|,|! so loud realli that it doe n't work terribl well as a silent ringer option|
|-1|,|other thing that i miss ar voice-activat dial and a standard 25 mm headset jack|
|-1|,|- some featur in the user interfac - no voic activat dial ( what were thei think - no option for caller-id pictur or individualiz rington|
|-1|,|- no propietari headset jack onli if we could get on camera in it|
|-1|,||
|-1|,|the volum kei can be hard to press but i think thi mai be by design rather than a flaw perhap to keep you from press it accident when you ar in a call|
|-1|,|pc cabl is too expens  $ 50 for a usb cabl ? the 661|,0 ha the radio function which is utterli useless|
|-1|,|it also ha a stock track app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat us applic which convert all type of metric ( currenc length area etc )|
|-1|,|regard pc softwar support nokia suit doe not work with some version of xp as i tri to connect my phone via infrar port on my laptop|
|-1|,|i thought thi wa the ultim phone when it come to basic featur but i wa dissapoint when i saw that it wa onli a gsm comapt phone|
|-1|,|it quiet|
|-1|,|i do here a constant high-pitch distort sound not to mention the volum doe not seem to be loud enough|
|-1|,|although i find it more conveni to us 1|,-touch dial thi phone doe not have voic dial|
|-1|,|the keypad is a decent size but the power on/off kei is small and difficult to press|
|-1|,|in my opinion the worst issu on thi phone is the side-mount volum control|
|-1|,|on other issu is that the headphon jack is uniqu to nokia so standard headphon will not work|
|-1|,|on complaint  the screen is too easili scratch|
|-1|,|! on more thing the default rington that come with the phone ar horribl|
|-1|,|the onli problem that i have found with the internet servic is that it doe not access ml ( real estat broker softwar ) veri well at all|
|-1|,|i find the lack of entertain game on thi phone quit disturb|
|-1|,|my onli gripe about the hardwar is the button|
|-1|,|thi model doe have the tradit kei arrang it 's just that thei ar realli close to on anoth and have unconvent shape so it take a big gett us to for someon like me with big hand|
|-1|,|final i reiter my thumbs-down rate for t-mobil as a carrier|
|-1|,|their network coverag is veri sporad and the network alwai seem overload result in veri unpleas call experi|
|-1|,|unfortun the 661|,0 doe not offer voic dial like my previou phone but the other featur it pack outweigh thi shortcom|
|-1|,|the gpr connect is sometim slow and write instant messag with the includ aol instant messeng softwar is a pain but the other t-zone applic ar quit us|
|-1|,|on downsid : as of thi write t-mobil ha n't updat their t-zone system to fulli support the 661|,0|
|-1|,|the on huge disappoint is that the phone manufactur for t-mobil lack mani of the menu and function that a nokia straight from the manufactur should have|
|-1|,|the internet function of the phone - wap and gpr - will onli work through t-mobil 's servic becaus thei have delet the menu option that would enabl you to configur the phone to be us on a differ network|
|-1|,|howev the main problem that i think is the with the sound qualiti|
|-1|,|when talk the voic is not veri clear|
